# dash_hexagons_svalbard
## In this dash I used ecological parameters used several environmental parameters taken from the Copernicus database (for several months) and depth data from the Gebko database related to the Svalbard area. The data were recalculated relative to h3 cells and summarized in a single table
Here hexagons here hexagon demonstrate color changes depending on the parameter value (used GeoJSON in Dash-leaflet), the main maps are actually choropleth
Process of preparing data described here:
